## Example 1

I think it's interesting how all the options work together, without having to do something like docker run -i -t ubuntu bash or something.
I ran the code ```docker run -it ubuntu bash``` and it was able to successfully able to run ubuntu's bash terminal.
I ran into an error trying to make a file in vim, and I couldn't figure out how to exit vim other than by closing the docker terminal. 
I also couldn't install cowsay with the command line ```apt install cowsay``` because it gave the message ```E: Unable to locate package cowsay```.
A TA came by and helped me by saying that I had to run ```apt update``` again, so I did that.
